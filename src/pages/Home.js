          <p>
            We realize Zoom University makes it kinda hard to — you know —
            actually make friends in your classes. And let’s face it, every
            class is more bearable when you have homies with fire explanations
            the day before your midterm from hell.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            So, we created this study buddy matching service to make sure being
            virtual doesn’t stop you from finding the friends that can help you
            get that shiny A.

          <h1 style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>How does it work?</h1>
          <p>
            Once you complete the form by entering your class and some of your
            study habits (due September 4th!), we will let you know your Study
            Buddies via email by September 5th.
          </p>
          <p>
            We know that it's pretty hard to study with someone who you aren't
            friends with so we have also included a few personality questions.
            We will use this data to match you up so you can dominate the class
            together.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of this data will be completely anonymized and private, so you
            have nothing to worry about.

          <p>
            <b>Can I fill the form out for more than one class?</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes! You’re encouraged to. We’d love to give you a group of
            studybuddies for every class you’re taking this semester.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>When is the last day I can fill this out?</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            The form will close on September 4th at midnight because we want to
            get you your StudyBuddies by September 5th.
