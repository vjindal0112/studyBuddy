            Everyone knows that the worst way to study is alone. If you have a
            question it's infinitely easier to find an answer when you have a
            friend to figure it out with you.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            We created this because while attending Zoom University it is
            impossible to make a friend in classes since Bob is shoving his face
            with crumb cakes with his video off during class.

            Once you complete the form (enter your class and some of your study
            habits), we will let you know your Study Buddy by September 8th.

          <p>
            We know that it's pretty hard to study with someone who you aren't
            friends with so we have also included a few personality questions.
            We will use this data to match you up so that you can get some As
            together.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of this data will be completely anonymized and private, so you
            have nothing to worry about.
